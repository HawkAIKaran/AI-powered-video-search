# AI-powered-video-search
AI-powered audio-video search that transcribes, indexes, and vectorizes content for efficient keyword and semantic search across multiple languages. Users can directly navigate to relevant timestamps within videos, eliminating manual searching.

# Overview
1) **Efficient keyword and semantic search:** Our solution leverages AI to transcribe, vectorise, and index video content, enabling accurate and comprehensive search (including semantic search) across multiple languages.

2) **Personalised learning:** Adaptive learning features extract topics and keywords of varying difficulty from transcripts, presented as clickable buttons. Clicking on a keyword instantly navigates users to relevant timestamps within the video.

3) **Timestamp-based navigation:** Users can directly access specific moments within videos, eliminating manual searching.

4) **Gamified learning:** The adaptive learning approach can be extended to gamification, where users earn points or rewards for interacting with different content levels and completing challenges.

# Enhancements

1) **Adaptive Learning:** ask areas of interest from student/ teacher and/or use Generative AI to generate keywords of different difficulty levels from video transcript and when those keywords are clicked, our search solution produces relevant results.
   
   For example, keywords from video on “Modern Indian History”:
   
   Low Level Difficulty keywords: "East India Company", "Colonialism", "Mahatma Gandhi".
   
   High Level Difficulty keywords: "Permanent Settlement", "Macaulay", "Rowlatt Act".
   
2) **Adding Gamification:**

   a) **Points and Rewards System:** Students earn points for watching videos, completing searches, or using the clickable timestamps to find relevant content.

    For example, Task: Click on keywords --> Go to video --> Click on all timestamps --> Click on next timestamp is allowed only if 30 seconds have passed after clicking on previous timestamp --> More timestamps clicked == more score for student.

   b) **Levels and Progression:** As students accumulate points, they advance through levels. Difficulty of keywords     generated by Generative AI can keep on increasing with the levels.

   c) **Display leaderboards:** showing top performers, encouraging friendly competition.
